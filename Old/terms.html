                <h6 class="mt-5">Summary of Our Project</h6>
                <div class="text">Welcome to Senior Blockchain Company LLC, where we are revolutionizing the real estate
                  industry through blockchain
                  technology and NFTs. Our platform offers innovative investment opportunities, allowing users to invest
                  in real estate
                  projects by purchasing NFTs that represent fractional ownership. By accessing and using our platform,
                  you agree to be
                  bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). Please carefully read and understand the following
                  information before
                  proceeding.</div>

                <h6 class="mt-5">1. Definitions</h6>
                <div class="text">"SNR": SNR refers to the Senior token, our company's cryptocurrency. SNR plays a vital
                  role within our platform,
                  enabling users to access various features and benefits.
                  "NFT": NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token, representing unique digital assets. NFTs are utilized on our
                  platform to
                  represent fractional ownership in real estate projects.</div>


                <h6 class="mt-5">2. Terms of Service Acceptance</h6>
                <div class="text">By using our platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to
                  these Terms. These Terms govern
                  your relationship with Senior Blockchain Company LLC and your use of our platform. If you do not
                  agree, please refrain
                  from accessing or using our services.</div>


                <h6 class="mt-5">3. Conditions of Use</h6>
                <div class="text">We hold no responsibility for the price of SNR, as it is subject to market
                  fluctuations. The value of SNR may rise or
                  fall due to various factors, including market demand and external influences.
                  We do not guarantee the exact profit from real estate projects, as it depends on various market
                  conditions and external
                  factors beyond our control. Investment returns are subject to risks, and users should consider their
                  risk tolerance
                  before participating.
                  Users are solely responsible for accurate NFT and token transfers; we are not liable for any incorrect
                  or unauthorized
                  transactions. It is essential for users to verify transaction details before proceeding to avoid
                  potential loss or
                  errors.
                  While we make efforts to enhance the growth of SNR, we do not provide any guarantees or commitments in
                  this regard. The
                  market performance of SNR relies on multiple factors, and users should exercise prudence while making
                  investment
                  decisions.</div>


                <h6 class="mt-5">4. Account Registration</h6>

                  <strong>Investment Risks:</strong> Investing in real estate projects and cryptocurrencies involves

                  time. Users
                  should be aware of the potential for price volatility and should not invest more than they can afford
